Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. --83.255 and 10.234 respectively. 

Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein? --protein only is 86.4%

Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB? --4,563

```{R}
pdbsum <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
pdbsum
```
```{R}
x <- pdbsum$Total
x
```

```{R}
convert_comma_number <- function(x) {
  x <- gsub(',','', x)
  x <- as.numeric(x)
  return(x)
}

n.tot <- sum(convert_comma_number(x))
```

The `apply()` function takes any function and "apply" it over either the ROWs or COLs of a data.frame
```{R}
n.pdbsum <- apply(pdbsum, 2, convert_comma_number)
colSums(apply(pdbsum, 2, convert_comma_number)) / n.tot
```
```{R}
n.pdbsum[1, "Total"]/n.tot
```
`read_csv()` from library `readr` can remove `,` in the numeric data automatically

## Using Mol*

Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure? -- H is too small

Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have --308

Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains)

Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? --198

Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? --HOH (127), MK1 (1) 

Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? --2

```{R}
